flash.py just busily blinks an LED.

I'm using VSCode with the Pico-Go plugin.
Installation Instructions are [here](https://www.heise.de/developer/artikel/Gutes-Wetter-mit-Raspberry-Pi-Pico-MicroPython-und-Visual-Studio-Code-5066047.html) (German)
and getting the Pico Pi to run MicroPython is described [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/rp2040/getting-started/#getting-started-with-micropython).
